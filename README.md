Bitcoin Wallet (Testnet)

Bitwallet is a bitcoin wallet application. The purpose is demonstrate how work the bitcoin transactions. All transactions are made in Testnet. Is a lightweight wallet and don't need to download the blockchain. 
I don't use frameworks like Express, just bootstrap and jquery. And electron to generate executables application.
I made it most simple and compreensive possible. Eventually I will made improvements in code, and implement new features.
